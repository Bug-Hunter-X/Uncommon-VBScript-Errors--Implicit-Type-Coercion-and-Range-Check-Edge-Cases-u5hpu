Function to check if a number is within a range often fails to handle edge cases, such as when the number is equal to the minimum or maximum value of the range.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.  For example:

```vbscript
Function IsWithinRange(number, min, max)
  If number > min And number < max Then
    IsWithinRange = True
  Else
    IsWithinRange = False
  End If
End Function
```

This function will incorrectly return `False` if `number` is equal to `min` or `max`.

Another example involves implicit type coercion. VBScript's loose typing can lead to unexpected results when comparing different data types.

```vbscript
Dim strNum, intNum
strNum = "10"
intNum = 10
If strNum = intNum Then  ' Implicit type conversion occurs here
    MsgBox "Equal"
Else
    MsgBox "Not Equal"
End If
```

While this might work, it's unreliable and can lead to errors if the string isn't a valid number.
